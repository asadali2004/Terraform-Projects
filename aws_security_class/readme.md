Terraform Project: EC2 Instance with Custom Security Group

=======================================
üì¶ PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------------------------------
This Terraform configuration deploys an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) in the `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) region and creates a custom security group with well-defined inbound and outbound rules for common protocols (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

=======================================
üîß WHAT IT DOES
---------------------------------------
1. Uses the official latest Ubuntu 22.04 AMI from Canonical.
2. Launches a t2.micro EC2 instance (Free Tier eligible).
3. Uses the default VPC.
4. Creates a custom security group named `allow_tls` with the following rules:
   - ‚úÖ Ingress Rules:
     ‚Ä¢ HTTP (port 80) ‚Äî IPv4 & IPv6
     ‚Ä¢ HTTPS (port 443) ‚Äî IPv4 & IPv6
     ‚Ä¢ SSH (port 22) ‚Äî IPv4 & IPv6
   - ‚úÖ Egress Rules:
     ‚Ä¢ Allow all outbound traffic (both IPv4 and IPv6)

=======================================
üîê SECURITY GROUP RULES
---------------------------------------
‚úî Ingress (Inbound):
- Port 22 (SSH): From 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0
- Port 80 (HTTP): From 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0
- Port 443 (HTTPS): From default VPC CIDR and ::/0

‚úî Egress (Outbound):
- All traffic allowed (ip_protocol = "-1") for both IPv4 and IPv6

=======================================
üöÄ HOW TO DEPLOY
---------------------------------------
1. Initialize Terraform:
   terraform init

2. Preview changes:
   terraform plan

3. Apply configuration:
   terraform apply

4. To destroy resources:
   terraform destroy

=======================================
üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE
---------------------------------------
- main.tf ‚Äî contains all Terraform resources:
   ‚Ä¢ provider, data sources, EC2 instance
   ‚Ä¢ security group + rules

=======================================
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------------------------------
- EC2 instance is created without a key pair unless added manually.
- SSH is open to all (0.0.0.0/0); restrict it to your IP for better security.
- Make sure your AWS CLI is configured with valid credentials before running.
